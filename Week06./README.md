This code is designed to analyze options and portfolios based on certain inputs. It is broken down into three main problems, each with its own set of instructions and requirements. Here is a brief overview of each problem and what the code does:

Problem 1:
This problem requires the calculation of the time to maturity using calendar days, and the plotting of the value of the call and put options for a range of implied volatilities between 10% and 80%. The supply and demand are discussed, along with how they affect the implied volatility.

Problem 2:
This problem utilizes options data for AAPL and calculates the implied volatility for each option. The implied volatility vs the strike price for puts and calls are plotted, and the shape of these graphs are discussed along with the market dynamics that could cause these graphs.

Problem 3:
This problem uses portfolios data for AAPL and graphs the portfolio value over a range of underlying values. The shapes of these graphs are discussed and tied to other topics discussed in the lecture. The code then calculates Mean, VaR and ES using the daily prices data and an AR(1) model.

Overall, this code utilizes various financial models and calculations to analyze options and portfolios for AAPL. It requires input data such as the current stock price, risk-free rate, and dividend rate to perform its calculations. Users can adjust these inputs as necessary to perform their own analyses. The code is written in Python and uses various libraries such as pandas and matplotlib to perform its calculations and generate graphs.

It is recommended that users review the code and input data before running the code to ensure it meets their needs. The results of each problem are outputted in the form of graphs, which can be viewed and analyzed by the user.
